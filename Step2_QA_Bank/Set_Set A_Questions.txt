6. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A. Economies of scale
B. Brand loyalty
C. Switching costs
D. Government regulation

The correct answer is D. Government regulation. This is because government regulation does not directly impact a company's sensitivity to the business cycle, unlike the other options which can affect a company's performance during different stages of the cycle.

7. Which of the following best describes the relationship between market value and intrinsic value?
A) Market value is always higher than intrinsic value
B) Intrinsic value is always higher than market value
C) Market value and intrinsic value are equal or very close when markets are efficient
Correct answer: C) Market value and intrinsic value are equal or very close when markets are efficient

A. Identifying active equity investment opportunities
B. Formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy
C. Analyzing a company's financial ratios and profitability

13. Which of the following is NOT a factor that determines a company's sensitivity to the business cycle?

A) Economies of scale
B) Absolute cost advantages
C) Government regulation
D) Customer loyalty

Correct answer: D) Customer loyalty

Justification: The factors listed in the question (economies of scale, absolute cost advantages, and government regulation) all affect a company's sensitivity to the business cycle, as they can impact the company's ability to adjust to changes in the economy. However, customer loyalty is not a factor that directly affects a company's sensitivity to the business cycle. Therefore, it is the correct answer.

A) It is possible to consistently beat the market by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk.
B) It is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis.
C) It is only possible to beat the market if there are a large number of market participants and extensive analyst coverage.

Correct answer: B) It is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis.

A. Strong form
B. Semi-strong form
C. Weak form

Answer: B. Semi-strong form

Justification: The semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. This includes information such as company financial statements, news articles, and economic data. In this form, fundamental analysis and technical analysis are not effective in consistently beating the market.

26. in terms of wording and complexity

C) Review the subject company's annual report for a discussion of the competitive environment
D) Review competitors' annual reports to identify other potential comparables

Correct answer: D) Review competitors' annual reports to identify other potential comparables

Justification: The correct answer is D because the reading explicitly states that reviewing competitors' annual reports is not a step in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies. Instead, the reading suggests reviewing industry trade publications, commercial classification systems, and the subject company's annual report to identify potential peer companies. This question tests the reader's understanding of the steps involved in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies and highlights the importance of using the appropriate sources for identifying peer companies.

C) International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities; Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community; North American Industry Classification System 

Answer: A) Products and/or services supplied; Business-cycle sensitivities; Statistical similarities 

Justification: The three main approaches to classifying companies, as stated in the context, are products and/or services supplied, business-cycle sensitivities, and statistical similarities. This information is important for analysts to understand because it provides insight into sources of industry revenue growth and competitors' market shares, which can affect a company's top-line growth and bottom-line profitability. The options B and C mention specific industry classification systems, which are not the main approaches to classifying companies.

44. Which form of efficient market hypothesis states that asset prices fully reflect all publicly known and available information?

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the difference between market efficiency and intrinsic value, as well as their ability to apply this knowledge in a real-world scenario. Option A correctly defines both terms and is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because market inefficiency can also result in a smaller gap between market value and intrinsic value. Option C is incorrect because behavioral finance is relevant in both efficient and inefficient markets.

47. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A) Customer switching costs
B) Government regulation
C) Market share stability
D) Absolute cost advantages

Correct answer: D) Absolute cost advantages

Justification: The factors that affect the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle include economies of scale, brand loyalty, customer switching costs, and government regulation.
