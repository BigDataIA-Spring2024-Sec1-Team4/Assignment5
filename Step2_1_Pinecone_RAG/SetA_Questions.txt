1. Which of the following is NOT a major category of equity valuation models?

A. Present value models
B. Multiplier models
C. Capital asset pricing models
D. Asset-based valuation models

Correct answer: C. Capital asset pricing models

Justification: The context mentions three major categories of equity valuation models: present value models, multiplier models, and asset-based valuation models. Capital asset pricing models are not mentioned as a category of equity valuation models.

2. Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding equity valuation models?

A. The choice of model should be based on the available information and the analyst's confidence in the information and the model's appropriateness.
B. Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form P/measure of fundamental variable or EV/measure of fundamental variable.
C. Dividend discount models estimate value based on the present value of expected future dividends.

Correct answer: B. Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form P/measure of fundamental variable or EV/measure of fundamental variable.
Justification: The correct answer is B because multiplier models use multiples of the form P/measure of fundamental variable or EV/measure of fundamental variable, not both. The other statements are true based on the context provided.

3. Which of the following statements accurately describes the efficient market hypothesis?

A) It states that it is impossible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk.
B) It states that markets are always perfectly efficient and asset prices fully reflect all information.
C) It states that market efficiency is only affected by the number of market participants. 

Correct answer: A) It states that it is impossible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk.

Justification: The efficient market hypothesis states that it is not possible to consistently outperform the market by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk. This is because markets are efficient and asset prices already reflect all available information. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it accurately describes the main conclusion of the efficient market hypothesis. Option B is incorrect as it suggests that markets are always perfectly efficient, which is not always the case. Option C is incorrect as it only mentions one factor that affects market efficiency, whereas the reading states that there are multiple factors that can affect it.

4. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?
A) Economies of scale
B) Customer switching costs
C) Competition from new entrants
D) Government regulation

Answer: D) Government regulation
Justification: The correct answer is D) Government regulation. This is because government regulation does not directly affect a company's sensitivity to the business cycle. The other options listed, such as economies of scale, customer switching costs, and competition from new entrants, can all impact a company's performance during different stages of the business cycle.

5. Which of the following accurately describes market efficiency?

A. The market value of an asset is always equal to its intrinsic value.
B. Market efficiency is not affected by the number of market participants.
C. In an efficient market, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information.

C. In an efficient market, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. 
Justification: According to the reading, in the semi-strong-form of market efficiency, prices reflect all publicly available information. This includes both past price and trading volume information, as well as all publicly known and available information. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

6. Which of the following is NOT a use of industry analysis?
A. Understanding a company's business and business environment
B. Identifying active equity investment opportunities
C. Identifying potential mergers and acquisitions
D. Formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy

7. Which of the following statements is true regarding market efficiency?

A. In a semi-strong-form efficient market, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information.
B. In a strong-form efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all market data.
C. In a weak-form efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all information, including both public and private information.

Correct answer: A. In a semi-strong-form efficient market, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information.

Justification: According to the context, in the semi-strong-form efficient market, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. In the strong-form efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all information, including both public and private information. In the weak-form efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all market data. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

8. Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of valuation models in equity analysis?

A. Valuation models must be complex in order to accurately estimate intrinsic value.
B. The goal of valuation is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast.
C. The choice of valuation model is not influenced by the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in the model.

B. The goal of valuation is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast. 
Justification: The context mentions that valuation is a fallible discipline and any method will result in an inaccurate forecast at some point. Therefore, the goal of valuation is to minimize this inaccuracy.

9. What is the main conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis? 

A. It is possible to consistently beat the market by generating returns in excess of expected levels of risk.
B. The efficiency of a market is not affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage.
C. It is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment. (Correct)

Justification: The reading states that the general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis is that it is not possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of those expected for the level of risk of the investment. This aligns with option C. Options A and B are incorrect, as the reading states the opposite.

10. Which of the following is NOT a category of equity valuation models?

A) Present value models
B) Multiplier models
C) Dividend discount models

C) Dividend discount models

11. Which of the following is NOT a purpose of industry analysis?
A) Understanding a company's business and business environment
B) Identifying active equity investment opportunities
C) Forecasting a company's future financial performance
Correct answer: C) Forecasting a company's future financial performance
Justification: Industry analysis is useful for understanding a company's business and business environment, identifying active equity investment opportunities, and formulating industry or sector rotation strategies. Forecasting a company's future financial performance is not a purpose of industry analysis, but rather a part of company analysis.

12. Which of the following is NOT a type of equity valuation model?
A. Present value models
B. Multiplier models
C. Asset-based valuation models
D. Growth models

The correct answer is D. Growth models are not a category of equity valuation models. They are a type of dividend discount model.

13. Which of the following is NOT a potential use of industry analysis according to the reading?

A. Understanding the competitive environment of a company
B. Identifying potential investment opportunities
C. Analyzing a company's financial statements
D. Formulating a sector rotation strategy

The correct answer is C. Analyzing a company's financial statements is not a use of industry analysis. According to the reading, industry analysis can be used for understanding a company's business and business environment, identifying investment opportunities, and formulating a sector rotation strategy, but analyzing a company's financial statements falls under the category of company analysis.

14. Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding equity valuation models?

A. The goal of valuation is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast.
B. Analysts often use more than one valuation model due to concerns about the applicability of any particular model.
C. The two-stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth.
D. The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D1/(r-g).

Correct answer: C. The two-stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth. (Justification: The statement is not true because the two-stage DDM estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth, not just the terminal value.)

15. Which of the following is NOT a potential use of industry analysis?
A) Understanding a company's business and business environment
B) Identifying active equity investment opportunities
C) Analyzing a company's financial ratios
Correct answer: C) Analyzing a company's financial ratios

Justification: According to the context, the choice of valuation model should be based on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model. The other options do not accurately reflect the factors that should be considered when choosing a valuation model.

18. Which of the following statements is true regarding market efficiency?

A) Markets are considered efficient when asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information.
B) Inefficient markets result in discrepancies between the intrinsic value and market value of assets.
C) Behavioral finance can fully explain market anomalies and irrational behaviors of market participants.

Correct answer: A) Markets are considered efficient when asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information.

Justification: This answer correctly describes the semi-strong form of market efficiency, which states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. Option B describes a possible result of market inefficiency, but it does not fully capture the concept. Option C is incorrect because behavioral finance can only partially explain market anomalies, not fully explain them.

19. Which of the following is NOT a key date in dividend chronology?
A. Declaration date
B. Ex-dividend date
C. Payment date
D. Record date

Correct answer: D. Record date

Justification: According to the context, key dates in dividend chronology include the declaration date, ex-dividend date, holder-of-record date, and payment date. The record date is not mentioned as a key date in the context.

21. Which of the following statements is true regarding market efficiency?

A) In an efficient market, the market value and intrinsic value of an asset should be equal.
B) The strong form of market efficiency suggests that asset prices fully reflect all publicly available information.
C) Market efficiency is not affected by the number of market participants or depth of analyst coverage.

A) In an efficient market, the market value and intrinsic value of an asset should be equal.
- This statement is true based on the reading, as it states that in an efficient market, the two values should be the same or very close.

B) The strong form of market efficiency suggests that asset prices fully reflect all publicly available information.
- This statement is false based on the reading, as the strong form of market efficiency includes both public and private information.

C) Market efficiency is not affected by the number of market participants or depth of analyst coverage.
- This statement is false based on the reading, as it states that the efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage.

22. Which approach to classifying companies is based on statistical similarities?
A) Product and/or service supplied
B) Business-cycle sensitivities
C) Statistical similarities

Answer: C) Statistical similarities

Justification: In the given context, it is mentioned that the three main approaches to classifying companies are products and/or services supplied, business-cycle sensitivities, and statistical similarities. The correct answer is C) Statistical similarities as it is specifically mentioned in the context.

23. Question: Which of the following statements is true regarding equity valuation models?

A. Multiples are based on fundamentals and comparables.
B. Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the present value of expected future benefits.
C. The choice of model depends on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence.

Correct answer: C. The choice of model depends on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence.

Justification: According to the context, the choice of valuation model depends on the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst's confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model. This is highlighted in the sentence: "The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model." Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it only describes the use of multiples, not the choice of model. Option B is incorrect because it describes the use of present value models, not asset-based valuation models.

24. Which of the following is NOT a category of equity valuation models?

A. Multiplier models
B. Asset-based valuation models
C. Dividend discount models

Correct Answer: C. Dividend discount models

Justification: The three categories of equity valuation models are present value models, multiplier models, and asset-based valuation models. Dividend discount models fall under the present value models category.

25. Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of valuation models to estimate intrinsic value?

A. The choice of model should be as complex as possible to ensure accuracy.
B. The choice of model depends on the analyst's confidence in the information and its appropriateness.

Answer: C. The efficient market hypothesis actually states the opposite - that it is not possible to consistently beat the market.

27. Question: According to the reading, which of the following best defines intrinsic value?
A) The price at which an asset can be bought or sold
B) The true value of an asset
C) All publicly known and available information
Answer: B) The true value of an asset
Justification: The reading defines intrinsic value as the true value of an asset, whereas market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. This was discussed in the section on market efficiency and the difference between intrinsic and market value.

28. Which of the following is NOT a key date in dividend chronology?

A. Declaration date
B. Ex-dividend date
C. Holder-of-record date
D. Payment date

B. Ex-dividend date

29. Question: Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A) Industry concentration
B) Technology
C) Market share stability

Correct answer: A) Industry concentration

Justification: Industry concentration is not a factor that directly affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle. Technology and market share stability are both external influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk, which can affect a company's performance in relation to the business cycle.

30. Which form of market efficiency states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information?

A. Weak form
B. Semi-strong form
C. Strong form

Correct answer: B. Semi-strong form

Justification: The semi-strong form of market efficiency states that asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information, making it the correct option. In the weak form, asset prices only reflect past price and trading volume information, while in the strong form, asset prices reflect both public and private information.

31. Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding equity valuation models?

A. Valuation models are strictly numerical and do not require any skill or judgment.
B. The choice of model and inputs should not be influenced by the available data.
C. Complex models are always more accurate than simple models.

Correct answer: C. Complex models are not always more accurate than simple models and should only be used if necessary. The law of parsimony states that a model should be kept as simple as possible in light of the available inputs.

32. What is the difference between market value and intrinsic value?

A) Market value is the true value of an asset, while intrinsic value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.
B) Market value is determined by public information, while intrinsic value is based on private information.
C) Market value is influenced by behavioral biases, while intrinsic value is based on rational decision making.

Correct answer: A) Market value is the true value of an asset, while intrinsic value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold.

Justification: This question tests the candidate's understanding of the difference between market value and intrinsic value, which are important concepts in market efficiency. The correct answer is A) as it accurately describes the difference between the two terms. Option B) is incorrect because intrinsic value can also be influenced by public information. Option C) is incorrect as both market value and intrinsic value can be influenced by behavioral biases.

33. Which of the following statements is true regarding equity valuation models?

A. Valuation models must be complex in order to accurately estimate intrinsic value.
B. The law of parsimony states that a model should be kept as complex as possible.
C. Valuation models are fallible and the goal is to minimize inaccuracy in forecasts.

Correct answer: C. Valuation models are fallible and the goal is to minimize inaccuracy in forecasts.

Justification: The passage states that valuation is a fallible discipline and the goal is to minimize inaccuracy in forecasts. The passage also mentions the law of parsimony, which states that a model should be kept as simple as possible. This contradicts option B. Option A is also incorrect because the passage states that complex models may improve on simple models, but complexity does not necessarily increase accuracy.

34. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects a market's efficiency?
A. Number of market participants
B. Depth of analyst coverage
C. Market volatility
Correct answer: C. Market volatility
Justification: Market volatility is not listed as a factor that affects a market's efficiency in the context. The correct answer is C.

A. Market value and intrinsic value will always be equal in an efficient market.
B. Market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly in an efficient market.
C. Market value and intrinsic value have no impact on market efficiency.

Correct answer: B. Market value and intrinsic value can diverge significantly in an efficient market.

Justification: In an efficient market, market value and intrinsic value should be close or equal. However, in cases where markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly. This is supported by the statement in the context that "when markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly."

36. Question: Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A) Industry classification
B) Market share stability
C) Barriers to entry

Correct answer: A) Industry classification

Justification: Industry classification is not a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle. Factors such as market share stability and barriers to entry can impact the level of competition and pricing power within an industry, which can in turn affect a company's performance during different stages of the business cycle.

37. Question: Which of the following statements about equity valuation models is correct?

A. Valuation models presented in the reading are the only ones used in the industry.
B. Complex models always lead to more accurate forecasts than simple models.

Correct answer: C. The reading mentions that the choice of valuation model depends on the available information and the analyst's confidence in both the information and the model's appropriateness. This is supported by the statement, "The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model."

38. Which of the following is NOT a main approach to classifying companies?

A) Products and/or services supplied
B) Business-cycle sensitivities 
C) Statistical similarities 
D) Geographic location 

Correct answer: D) Geographic location

Justification: According to the context, the three main approaches to classifying companies are products and/or services supplied, business-cycle sensitivities, and statistical similarities. Geographic location is not mentioned as a main approach to classifying companies.

39. Which of the following statements accurately describes the strong form of market efficiency?

A. Asset prices fully reflect all publicly known and available information.
B. Asset prices fully reflect all market data, including past price and trading volume information.
C. Asset prices fully reflect all information, including both public and private information.

Correct answer: C. Asset prices fully reflect all information, including both public and private information.

Justification: In the strong form of market efficiency, asset prices reflect all information, both public and private. This means that even private information, such as insider knowledge, is already incorporated into the asset's price, making it impossible to consistently outperform the market.

40. Which of the following statements is NOT true about equity valuation models?
A. They are widely used and serve an important purpose.
B. They should be kept as simple as possible in light of available inputs.
C. They always result in an accurate forecast.
D. The choice of model will depend on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model.

C. They always result in an accurate forecast. 
Justification: The context mentions that valuation is a fallible discipline and any method will result in an inaccurate forecast at some time. The goal is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast. Therefore, it is not always true that equity valuation models result in an accurate forecast.

41. Which of the following is NOT a type of equity valuation model?

A) Present value model
B) Multiplier model
C) Cash flow model

Correct answer: C) Cash flow model

Justification: The reading specifically mentions present value models, multiplier models, and asset-based valuation models as the three major categories of equity valuation models. Cash flow model is not mentioned as a type of equity valuation model.

42. Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding market efficiency?

A. The efficient market hypothesis states that it is possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.
B. The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage.
C. Intrinsic value and market value should be the same or very close in an efficient market. 

The correct answer is A. The efficient market hypothesis actually states that it is not possible to consistently beat the market by generating excess returns.

43. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A. Brand loyalty
B. Absolute cost advantages
C. Geographic location

The correct answer is C. Geographic location does not affect the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle. Brand loyalty and absolute cost advantages are both factors that can affect a company's sensitivity to the business cycle.

44. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle?

A) Industry classification
B) Barriers to entry
C) Market share stability
D) Government regulation

Correct answer: D) Government regulation

Justification: Government regulation does not directly affect a company's sensitivity to the business cycle. The other options all have an impact on how a company is affected by changes in the business cycle. Industry classification can determine the type of business activities a company engages in, which can affect its performance during different stages of the business cycle. Barriers to entry and market share stability can also affect a company's competitiveness and sensitivity to the business cycle.

45. Which of the following is NOT a use of industry analysis?

A) Understanding a company's business and business environment
B) Identifying active equity investment opportunities
C) Forecasting a company's future stock price

The correct answer is C) Forecasting a company's future stock price. Industry analysis can provide insight into sources of industry revenue growth and competitors' market shares, but it is not intended for predicting a specific company's stock price.

46. Which of the following statements is true regarding equity valuation models?

A) Valuation models should always be complex in order to increase accuracy.
B) The choice of model should be based on the analyst's personal preference.
C) The choice of model depends on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in the information.

Correct answer: C) The choice of model depends on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in the information.

Justification: In the given context, it is mentioned that the choice of valuation model depends on the availability of information and the analyst's confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model. This is further supported by the statement that "the available data will, in most instances, restrict the choice of model and influence the way it is used." Thus, the correct answer is C.

47. Which of the following is NOT a factor that affects a market's efficiency?

A) Number of market participants and analyst coverage
B) Information availability
C) Historical price and trading volume information

Answer: C) Historical price and trading volume information

Justification: The correct answer is C) Historical price and trading volume information because this is one of the factors that does affect market efficiency, specifically in the weak form. The other two options, A) and B), are also mentioned as factors that affect market efficiency in the given context.

48. What is the main purpose of industry analysis?

A. To understand a company's business and business environment
B. To identify potential investment opportunities 
C. To develop a company's competitive strategy 

Correct answer: A. To understand a company's business and business environment 

Justification: The passage mentions that industry analysis is useful for understanding a company's business and business environment, as well as for identifying investment opportunities and developing a competitive strategy. However, the main purpose of industry analysis is to gain insight into the sources of industry revenue growth and competitors' market shares, which can then be used to understand and analyze a company's business and environment. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

49. Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of valuation models?

A. The choice of model should be based on the analyst's confidence in the information and appropriateness of the model.
B. The more complex the model, the more accurate the forecast will be.
C. Valuation models are infallible and will always result in an accurate forecast.

A. The choice of model should be based on the analyst's confidence in the information and appropriateness of the model. 

Justification: The context states that the choice of model should be based on the availability and reliability of information, as well as the analyst's confidence in the model. The complexity of a model does not necessarily equate to accuracy, and valuations are fallible.

50. Which of the following statements best describes market efficiency?

A. It refers to the ability of market participants to predict future asset prices accurately.
B. It means that all publicly available information is reflected in asset prices.
C. It suggests that investors can consistently outperform the market by generating higher returns with lower risk.

Correct answer: B. It means that all publicly available information is reflected in asset prices.

Justification: Market efficiency refers to the idea that asset prices reflect all available information. This means that all publicly known and available information is already incorporated into the price of an asset, making it difficult for investors to consistently outperform the market.
